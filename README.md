#PROGSRADIO

This is a infinite radio app that I created just for fun.Basically it plays some songs(which i got from rapidapi's shazam core api) on infinite loop.This whole app is built with ReactJS.


There were things that I learnt from this project such as-

 * Creating custion hook in react.
 * Using RapidAPI(this if the firs time i used rapid api service with its vs code extension
 * Playing with audio in reactjs.
 

I've used https://radio.madza.dev as the reference for this app so I thank him for this amazing idea.
